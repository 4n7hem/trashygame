---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-Below here, everything is exclusively optional, but it would be a great polishment to actually add them-
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wall on the first wagon of level 2 is breakable, allowing you to jump off the train, acessing the sewers (secret boss fight)
Using konami code on level 3 would make a completely different boss fight (another secret boss fight, maybe just stick jevil in there dunno)
Achievements, so the player would keep track of all the secrets
Collectables?
Make so that that one single interaction on the very beginning actually holds a crap load of secrets
Level selection unlocked when one ends the game for the first time
Also saving whatever their progress is so things from other levels interact with each other
