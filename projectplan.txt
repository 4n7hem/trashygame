Everything that is desire to exist on the game:

		Make a select character option(at least thats what the potatoes want)
	Options button
		Make the volume drawers work
		Make resolution settings, maybe		
	Credits button
		Rewrite it so it credits the right people
	Quit button
		Works as intended.

Gameplay
	Make the player attack (melee)(22/04) - iquick
	Make the player walk - (06/04)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-Below here, everything is exclusively optional, but it would be a great polishment to actually add them-
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wall on the first wagon of level 2 is breakable, allowing you to jump off the train, acessing the sewers (secret boss fight)
Using konami code on level 3 would make a completely different boss fight (another secret boss fight, maybe just stick jevil in there dunno)
Achievements, so the player would keep track of all the secrets
Collectables?
Make so that that one single interaction on the very beginning actually holds a crap load of secrets
Level selection unlocked when one ends the game for the first time
Also saving whatever their progress is so things from other levels interact with each other
